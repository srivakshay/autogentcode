### Domain Model

The domain model for this project is based on the stored procedure and DB conventions. The following JPA @Entity classes have been generated:
```
[FILE: src/main/java/com/example/sample2/domain/Order.java]
```
package com.example.sample2.domain;

import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Table(name = "orders")
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String customerName;

    private Double totalAmount;

    private Boolean priority;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getCustomerName() {
        return customerName;
    }

    public void setCustomerName(String customerName) {
        this.customerName = customerName;
    }

    public Double getTotalAmount() {
        return totalAmount;
    }

    public void setTotalAmount(Double totalAmount) {
        this.totalAmount = totalAmount;
    }

    public Boolean getPriority() {
        return priority;
    }

    public void setPriority(Boolean priority) {
        this.priority = priority;
    }
}

### README

This project uses the following domain model:

* `Order`
  * `@Entity`
  * `@Table(name = "orders")`
  * `id`: `@Id`
  * `customerName`: `String`
  * `totalAmount`: `Double`
  * `priority`: `Boolean`

The stored procedure `process_orders` is used to update the orders table. The following fields are inferred from the SP:

* `id`: `@Id`
* `customerName`: `String`
* `totalAmount`: `Double`
* `priority`: `Boolean`

---

### Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made for this phase:

* The stored procedure `process_orders` is used to update the orders table.
* The domain model is based on the stored procedure and DB conventions.
* The schema of the database is unknown, so the minimal viable fields used by the SP are inferred.

---

### Next Phase

The next phase would be to generate the JPA repository for the `Order` entity. This will allow us to interact with the orders table using Spring Data JPA.
